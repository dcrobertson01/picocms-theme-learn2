# Installation
## Modify the httpd template.
The **Learn2** theme for **[GravCMS](https://getgrav.org)** is designed for documentation, and is used on the **[Grav Documentation Site](https://learn.getgrav.org)** This is an attempt to port it to **[PicoCMS](http://picocms.org)**, mainly so I can use it with the **[cms_pico](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico)** module for **[Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.org)**.

## Installation
um will do this later
## Modifications
Am trying to make it a little more accessible. Eg - remove h5 tags that are being used for formatting rather than as structural elements.
