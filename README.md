## Title: Learn2 Documentation

The **Learn2** theme for **[GravCMS](https://getgrav.org)** is designed for documentation, and is used on the **[Grav Documentation Site](https://learn.getgrav.org)** This is an attempt to port it to **[PicoCMS](http://picocms.org)**, mainly so I can use it with the **[cms_pico](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico)** module for **[Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.org)**.

This is a very early version of the theme, and there is still a fair bit to be done. It will be on hold for a bit. 

**Warning**
~~ Search and the site feeds do not work.~~ And possibly other plugins.

## [Installation](https://cloud.robertson.net.nz/index.php/apps/cms_pico/pico/learn2/docs/installation)

Copy the themes/learn2 directory to the cms_pico themes directory

Copy the Learn2 directory to the cms_pico templates directory

Copy the contents of the plugins directory to the cms_pico plugins directory

Go to the Administration pages for cms_pico in Nextcloud and add the theme,  templates, and plugins to cms_pico.

Create a new site, using learn2 as your theme.

Might work :-)

## Modifications

Am trying to make it a little more accessible. Eg - remove h5 tags that are being used for formatting rather than as structural elements.
